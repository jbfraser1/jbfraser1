Not that Jamie F, I'm a geek living the middle of the US.

I've spent a fair number of hours in the last couple years working
 on [SailScores](https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores)

- I've done a lot of fullstack work, concentrating in the
 Microsoft ecosystem.

- Random tip: the secret to getting plenty of rep on Stack
 Overflow? Find an area that not too many people know and
 you're interested in learning: then you can take time
 submitting answers, while you research stuff yourself.
